-> Hi, Iâ€™m @SpaceCadet11Games, but you can just call me Space, or Cadet, or a combination of both, whatever's easiest.  
-> I'm currently learning Unreal Engine to make games. It'll take a while to figure things out, but eventually I'll have something to show for it.    

-> Currently, I'm working on a 2.5D platformer with levels that can wrap around the environment.  
-> I'm still new at this, and a lot of my Blueprint scripts are borrowed-script chimeras with some extra bits I figured out myself added on.  
-> Even though it's in a really early phase, I'm quite proud of it, and I hope it can become something people can enjoy one day.    

-> Be careful when asking me a question, the most likely response to get is going to end up being a short essay. I'll try to be sure to add on a TL:DR paragraph at the end, though.    

-> Also, if you're looking to buy a doormat online, then wow you really took a wrong turn somewhere. Like seriously, how did you even get here?
