-> Hi, Iâ€™m SpaceCadet11Games, but you can just call me Space, or Cadet, or a combination of both, whatever's easiest.  

-> I work for Durable Programming, doing web development - upgrading existing websites is our specialty.  
-> I really enjoy my work, and tend to get really hyperfocused on it to the point where I might completely forget to take lunch until like 3:00 PM.  

-> Outside of my secular work, I'm interested in video games and dabble in gamedev as a hobby. I don't have much to show for it now aside from the many unfinished assets on my computer and the skills I've picked up on the way.  
-> My current project is a 2.5D game I'm trying to make in the Godot engine. I previously had a project in Unreal Engine, but decided I don't really need all the bells and whistles that engine has - I've come a long way as a programmer since I made that using visual scripting Blueprints.  
-> I have a 3D character model probably ~90% finished for it, though that model has been to the ~90% finished mark before and I've restarted it around 5 times now since I wasn't satisfied with the result.  
-> Will the game ever be finished? Maybe. Will it ever be successful? Less likely, but I'll be happy to just make a finished project.  

-> Be careful when asking me a question, the most likely response to get is going to end up being a short essay. I'll try to be sure to add on a TL;DR paragraph at the end, though.    

-> Also, if you're looking to buy a doormat online, then wow you really took a wrong turn somewhere. Like seriously, how did you even get here?
